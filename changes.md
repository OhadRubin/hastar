# Character Animation Feature Changes

## New Files Added

### `src/hooks/useCharacterAnimation.js`
- **Purpose**: Custom React hook for animating character movement along pathfinding routes
- **Features**:
  - Manages character position state during animation
  - Controls animation timing and speed
  - Triggers callback when animation completes
  - Prevents new animations while one is running

## Modified Files

### `src/components/maze-component.js`

#### New Imports
- Added `useCharacterAnimation` hook import

#### New State Variables
- `animationSpeed` - Controls how fast the character moves (default: 200ms per step)

#### New Functions
- **`handleNewPath()`** - Generates new random start/end points in the existing maze without regenerating the entire maze
  - Reuses existing maze, componentGraph, and coloredMaze
  - Finds new pathfinding solution for the new points
  - Called when character animation completes to create continuous movement

#### Updated Functions
- **`handleGenerateMaze()`** - Remains unchanged but now separate from path regeneration
- **Character animation integration** - Uses `useCharacterAnimation` hook with `handleNewPath` as completion callback

#### Visual Changes
- **Character representation**: Blue circle (●) that moves along the path
- **Dynamic status text**: Shows "Character is moving..." during animation
- **Path visualization**: X marks only show when not animating
- **Character highlighting**: Character position gets blue background color
- **Legend updates**: Added character indicator to legend

#### UI Enhancements
- **Animation speed slider**: Range input (50ms - 500ms) to control movement speed
- **Disabled state**: "Generate New Maze" button disabled during animation
- **Speed control**: Disabled during animation to prevent conflicts

#### Behavior Changes
- **Continuous animation**: Character automatically finds new paths in the same maze
- **Maze persistence**: Maze only regenerates when explicitly requested via button
- **Animation loop**: Character → reaches end → pause 1 second → new path → repeat

## Key Features

1. **Character Animation Speed**: Configurable from 50ms to 500ms per step
2. **Automatic Path Generation**: Creates new random paths in the same maze automatically
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication when character is moving vs. static
4. **User Control**: Can still manually generate new mazes or toggle abstract path view
5. **Smooth Experience**: Disabled controls during animation prevent conflicts

## Technical Implementation

- Uses React hooks for state management
- Leverages setTimeout for step-by-step animation
- Maintains existing pathfinding algorithms unchanged
- Preserves all original maze generation and HAA* functionality
- Adds responsive UI controls with proper disabled states
